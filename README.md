# Cell-based Hipster Shop Application

All details of the original Hipster Shop: Cloud-Native Microservices Demo Application can be found [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo). 

Cellery is a code-first approach to building, integrating, running and managing composite microservice applications on Kubernetes. Read the [Cellery documentation](https://github.com/wso2-cellery/sdk) to learn how to set up Cellery and get started. 

The Hipster Shop project contains a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app called **“Hipster Shop”** where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

## Service Architecture

**Hipster Shop** is composed of many microservices written in different languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

languages that talk to each other over gRPC. This sample is structured into 5 cells: 
- ads-cell
- products-cell
- cart-cell
- checkout-cell
- front-end-cell
